The main script ssd_detection_full_script.py does the following:
- detect if a person or a cat is seen on the webcam;
- play an audio file if such an event occur;
- record a video of the event;
- send an email with the video attached.

It uses several classes of neural network from the openCV library. 
More specifically, it relies on the SSD algorithm.

This project can be run on a raspberry pi.
